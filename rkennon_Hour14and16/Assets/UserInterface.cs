/*
 First I changed the background to an image I saved in the past for a different assignment, downloaded off the internet.

Second I changed the Title, Subtext, and Start Text to match the theme, turning it into the start screen of a no-n-existant sci-fi game.
- The title became Protocal 0, the sub text a decoration for the theme, and the start button "Initiate Red".

Third I changed the colors of the text and the button's transition colors.

Lastly I moved the anchors to the best of my ability to keep the texts where I intended them to be at when the screen changes in size.
 -Left Side cuts off when I enlarge the screen but I couldn't solve it.
-I was able to solve the text lining up with the background issue by adjusting the achors and setting the Font Size to Auto Size.
