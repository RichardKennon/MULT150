 Made a quick prefab to attach the particles to and a Launch Pad to push off against.

 1. I gave the particles collision set to Type: World with a Collider Force of 50.
 
 2. I attempted to give the particles a lighting feature by adding a new lightsource and attaching it with a 0.6 ratio.

-2.1 I also created a gray collored ground material in hopes of seeing a glow.

 4. I changed the renderer to a sphere mesh and scaled it down.

 5. I created a new material called RocketFlames and attached it to the renderer, making the spheres transparent, red, and somewhat shiny.

This was all done in order to not only make the particles look like a rocket's flare, but also make the particles themselves the source of the thrust!
