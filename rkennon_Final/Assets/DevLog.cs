    In regards to extra credit, does animating the player character count? I wanted to do so much but got set back by hours fixing fatal errors I couldn't find the origin too.
    I also attempted to make the sound clip for the donut activate with the trigger rather than loop endlessly- which was right around when I got that fatal error and my plans
came crashing down around my head and the whole assignment came down to the wire- as of typing this, I have 9 minutes to submit.

    Ah well, good news is at least the Hierarchy is orgainized.
